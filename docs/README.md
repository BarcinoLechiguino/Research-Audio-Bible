## Who is responsible for the creation of the Audio Bible?

The Audio Bible is a document created by the Audio Director and the Sound Designer; always maintaining a close collaboration with the director of the project, the art team and the design team. ![Zachary Quarles Sound Designer](https://www.google.com/searchq=Zachary+Quarles&rlz=1C1GGRV_enES751ES751&sxsrf=ALeKk03JDt4X8xr01Of_5V4n1VcyiU_zZQ:1583266133016&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj7xsX7jf_nAhVCqxoKHYW3Cq8Q_AUoAXoECAsQAw&biw=1920&bih=975#imgrc=EIh6tBB37SmWYM)
That collaboration is crucial, being the main problem in indie companies.
This document is designed to help the audio team, as well as the programmers who will need the document to implement the sound into the game. 
[Keith Ziza](http://keithzizza.com/) in one of his interviews said:
```
Designers will want to absorb it, programmers will demand it, and producers, along with just anyone else who is involved on the project, will want to at least skim it. Whether it’s one page or one hundred, it should be as descriptive as it needs to be for you and for your development team. The end result, hopefully, is a harmonious one… working with and enhancing graphics, writing, game design, and the overall gaming experience. ( [Keith Ziza](http://keithzizza.com/) 2000).

## How it affects the creation of audio?

As I said before it’s a team effort with an attention to detail that puts the audio experience over the top.  When you’re establishing your audio vision, make sure that you are taking the elements of Music, Sound-Design (Effects), Voice-Over, and Technology into account.  Each element has their subcomponents and everything needs to work together to make for the most cohesive experience.  If one element is neglected or “tacked-on”, it can throw your entire audio direction into disarray.

This is a list of parameters you need to take into account while selecting/designing your audio.
